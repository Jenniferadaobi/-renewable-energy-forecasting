A time-series forecasting project analyzing solar photovoltaic and wind, wave, and tidal energy trends in the UK using ARIMA modeling.

# Renewable Energy Forecasting in the UK

### Overview
This project applies time-series forecasting (ARIMA modeling) to predict the future contributions of solar photovoltaic and wind, wave, and tidal energy in the UK.

The study leverages data from the UK Office for National Statistics (1990-2022) and uses R for statistical modeling, ggplot2 for visualization, and Excel for data storage and preprocessing.

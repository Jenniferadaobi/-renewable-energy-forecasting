# -renewable-energy-forecasting
A time-series forecasting project analyzing solar photovoltaic and wind, wave, and tidal energy trends in the UK using ARIMA modeling.

# Renewable Energy Forecasting in the UK

### Overview
This project applies **time-series forecasting (ARIMA modeling)** to predict the future contributions of **solar photovoltaic and wind, wave, and tidal energy** in the UK.

The study leverages data from the **UK Office for National Statistics (1990-2022)** and uses **R/Python for statistical modeling, Power BI for data visualization, and Excel for exploratory analysis**.

---

### Key Findings
- **Wind, wave, and tidal energy** show strong future growth.
- **Solar photovoltaic energy** faces scalability challenges and requires policy intervention.
- ARIMA modeling predicts **energy production trends for the next 10 years**.
- Data-driven insights provide recommendations for policymakers and industry leaders.
